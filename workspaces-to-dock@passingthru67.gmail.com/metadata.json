    "description": "A Gnome Shell extension that transforms the workspaces of the overview mode into an intellihide dock.  The dock is positioned and sized to maintain tight integration with the Gnome Shell.\n\nThe latest release includes an option to require mouse pressure to activate and show the dock (GS 3.8+ only), the ability to customize the thumbnail size, the ability to toggle the dock using a keyboard shortcut, and RTL support.\n\nPlease see the Github homepage for details on installation, settings, known issues, and version features. A backport is also available on Github for Gnome Shell 3.2 users (v6 only).",
